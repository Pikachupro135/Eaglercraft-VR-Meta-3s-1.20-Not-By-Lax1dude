# Eaglercraft VR Meta 3s (Not offical version: 1.20) NOT BY LAX1DUDE
This is a fun little idea I got from when I got my Meta quest 3s for Christmas. I decided I wanted to make a Eaglercraft that would run on VR and act like Minecraft VR. Hope you like "Mod" Or should I say a version for VR. ^w^

# Whats in this:
It comes with freely moving minecraft hands which are fun, but you cant forget, YOU CAN YOU COSTOM SKINS!!! Yes you heard me. Use. Your. Own. Skins. With the hand anamation!?!? Oh and one more thing: It comes with shaders. So what are you waitting for... Get out there!!!
