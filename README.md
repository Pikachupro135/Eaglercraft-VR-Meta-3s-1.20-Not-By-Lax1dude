# Eaglercraft VR Meta 3s (Not offical version: 1.20) NOT BY LAX1DUDE
This is a fun little idea I got from when I got my Meta quest 3s for Christmas. I decided I wanted to make a Eaglercraft that would run on VR and act like Minecraft VR. Hope you like "Mod" Or should I say a version for VR. ^w^

# Whats in this:
It comes with free moving minecraft hands which are fun, but not to metion but, YOU CAN YOU COSTOM SKINS!!! Yes you heard me. Use. Your. Own. Skins. With the hand anamation!?!?
